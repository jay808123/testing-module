# Integration testing and Mocking | JavaScript | 1


## Learning outcomes

You will learn to:
* Set up Jest
* Write mocks
* Running integration tests

## Introduction

This section should give a brief introduction to the coming task, provide some insight into the topics covered in the task: definition, importance etc..

[ ] Understand the concept of integration testing and its significance in the software development process.

[ ] Learn how integration tests differ from unit tests and end-to-end tests.

[ ] Explore the benefits and challenges of integration testing.


## Objectives

This section should introduce the task to the student in depth.

### Setting up Jest
   - Install Jest as the testing framework for your JavaScript project.
   - Configure Jest to work with your project's specific setup and dependencies.

### Writing your first integration tests
   - Define a clear testing strategy and identify the components or modules that require integration testing.
   - Create test files for your integration tests, following the naming conventions and directory structure.
   - Write integration test cases to validate the interaction and integration between different modules or components of your application.
   - Use Jest's testing APIs, such as `describe`, `test`, `expect`, and various matchers, to structure and assert the expected behavior of the integrated components.

### Working with Mocks
   - Understand the concept of mocking and its role in integration testing.
   - Learn different mocking techniques, such as manual mocks, module mocks, and function mocks.
   - Use Jest's mocking capabilities to create mocks for external dependencies, APIs, or modules that your components interact with during integration testing.
   - Implement mock functions, return values, and behavior to simulate the expected responses from the mocked dependencies.


### Running Integration Tests
   - Execute the integration tests using the Jest test runner.
   - Analyze the test results, including passing and failing tests, code coverage, and any reported errors or failures.
   - Use Jest's command-line options and configuration settings to customize the test execution process.




## Instructions

This section should guide the student through the necessary actions and provide any specific requirements or considerations. 

Provide a function that calls an API -> ask a student to cover the functionality with integration tests including mocking of the response



## Usage *optional*

This section should contain example outputs of a completed program.

## Allowed packages/technologies *optional*

This section should contain list of allowed packages/technologies the student must/could use for their project.

## Advice

This section should contain links to any helpful sources so that the student has a starting point and does not feel completely lost.
